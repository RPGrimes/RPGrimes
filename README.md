### <a name="AboutMe">About Me</a>

I am a determined and driven aspiring full-stack developer with a background in engineering and geology. I am looking to join a team in a positive and supportive environment where principles such as TDD are followed and where a growth mindset is encouraged.

My interest in coding began in 2020 where I completed online JavaScript and Ruby tutorials and **loved** them! I particularly enjoy that coding incorporates a blend of creative thinking with logical reasoning and problem solving. The more I learnt about coding, the more I wanted to learn and it became abundantly apparent to me that I needed to pursuit a career in the discipline.

After five years of working as an engineering geologist in the construction industry I decided wanted a new and more fulfilling challenge as a developer. Therefore, I am currently enrolled at [Makers](https://makers.tech/), a highly selective intensive coding program.

| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| [**Acebook**](https://github.com/RPGrimes/Acebook) | Team engineering challenge where the goal was to build an social media close, taking inspiration from Facebook | Ruby-on-Rails, RSpec, Capybara, BCrypt, PostgreSQL, Bootstrap CSS, HTML, git |
| [**Thermostat**](https://github.com/RPGrimes/Thermostat) | Pair-programming challenge where the task was to build a thermometer that can be set/changed via the command line. It also utilises a weather API to call the temperature from an entered city | JavaScript, Jest, APIs, HTML, git  |
| [**News Summary Challenge**](https://github.com/RPGrimes/news-summary-challenge) | An individual weekend challenge where the task was to generate a news page utilising an API. | JavaScript, Jest, APIs, CSS, HTML, git |

**Excellent communication time management and teamworking** - During my time at as an engineering geologist I routinely managed a number of projects spanning multiple disciplines simultaneously. In order for this to be manageable and for all projects to meet their requirements, deadlines and budgets the teams had to regularly liaise with one another to provide updates on how work was progressing, any issues they may have encountered and how they were planning to proceed in a clear and concise manner. Having these skills has helped me to articulate a concept when I am explaining it to others and aided me with pair programming/group work.

**Detail focused** - Regularly peer reviewing colleagues reports and calculations was always quality assurance prior to issuing client reports in my last role. This well-established behaviour is one I carry across to 'quality check' my code using TDD and helps me write code that is easily readable and succinct.

### <a name="PersonalInterests">Personal Interests</a>

- **Cricket**: I am a keen cricketer who's ability unfortunately does not match my level of enthusiasm
- **Football**: Much like with cricket, enthusiasm > ability, but that doesn't stop me playing 5-a-side, 6-a-side or 11-a-side whenever I can!
- **Food**: I prefer eating it over cooking it, I'm on a mission to try as many different national cuisines as possible
- **Travel**: Visiting new places, experiencing new cultures (and cuisines as mentioned above!) and meeting new people are all aspects of travel that appeal
- **Gaming**: Not quite as avid as I was during my teenage years, but I still thoroughly enjoy spending some of my free time on my computer or PlayStation
